Blend until you get a smooth paste. You can also use a mortar and pestle to pound the ingredients until they're well combined.\\n\\n2. **Sear the chicken**: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until they're browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside.\\n\\n3. **Make the soup base**: In the same pot, add the blended galangal mixture and cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the chicken broth, fish sauce, and palm sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes.\\n\\n4. **Add the coconut milk**: Stir in the coconut milk and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the soup has thickened slightly.\\n\\n5. **Add the chicken**: Return the chicken to the pot and cook until it's cooked through.\\n\\n6. **Season and serve**: Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and chili sauce (if using). Serve the soup hot, garnished with fresh Thai basil leaves and a sprinkle of pepper.
